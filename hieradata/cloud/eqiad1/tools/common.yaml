# We don't usually store hiera data for the tools project here.
# This is an exception, because we are trying to move the whole CloudVPS away
# from the nscd stack to sssd. But that migration requires a reboot.
# We rebooted the tools cluster to adopt sssd, but we don't want to force all
# VMs in CloudVPS the same way.
# Anyway, the default in Debian Buster is sssd, so when stretch goes away, all
# the puppet code supporting nscd can be dropped.
#
# So, why this hiera here? Because the default is nscd. If the puppet enc
# service fails or is unreliable for any reason, no hiera will be available
# in the puppetmaster, and it will use default values, reverting the whole
# tools cluster to nscd.
#
# So, again, we don't usually store hiera data for the tools project here
# but decided to take this shortcut while we figure out the nscd mess.
