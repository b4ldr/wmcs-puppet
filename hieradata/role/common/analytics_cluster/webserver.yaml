# Please note: the service name is used to pick up the
# TLS certificate that envoy will use. Since the Analytics
# team has only one certificate for its UIs, then the service
# name listed does not reflect how the envoy proxy is set up.
# analytics.wikimedia.org and stats.wikimedia.org are SANs
# of the yarn.wikimedia.org TLS certificate.
