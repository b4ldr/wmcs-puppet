# OSD nodes have their own storage vlan; these hosts
#  will have arbitrary cluster addresses in 192.168.4.0/22
#
# The 'public' address here does not refer to the WMF public vlan,
#  but rather the ceph 'public' address which is used by clients
#  (in the near-term, hypervisors) to access storage.  Do not be
#  alarmed that the public addresses are on private IPs.
