# == Class airflow
# Base class for declaring airflow::instances.
# Installs the WMF airflow .deb package as a conda environment into /usr/lib/airflow.
#
# Creates an 'airflow' control systemd service that all airflow::instance services
# declare themselves PartOf.  This can be used for easy managing of all local airflow services.
#
# Also installs a check_cmd used for NRPE checks when an airflow::instance
# has $monitoring_enabled => true.
