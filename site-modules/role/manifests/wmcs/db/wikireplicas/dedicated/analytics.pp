# Class role::wmcs::db::wikireplicas::dedicated::analytics
#
# This role is a special use case of role::wmcs::db::wikireplicas::analytics,
# adapted for the clouddb host used exclusively by the Analytics team.
# Some differences:
# - A different hiera config to allow to tune pt-kill configs
#   without affecting the 'regular' wikireplica hosts.
# - A different set of firewall rules for port 3306, to allow
#   Analytics hosts (especially Hadoop worker nodes) to contact
#   the wikireplica Analytics host.
