# == Class role::dumps::generation::worker::beta_testbed
#
# Set up a dumps snapshot instance as a testbed.
#
# Because this class uses mediawiki, the class
# role::beta::mediawiki must be applied to the instance
# as well.  The role can't be included in this class for
# style reasons.
#
# You should be using at least a m1.medium instance,
# giving some extra lvm space locally mounted on
# which to write the dumps.
