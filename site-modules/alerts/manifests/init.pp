# Provide the ability to deploy Prometheus alerting rules from git repository (typically
# operations/alerts) into a directory for Prometheus to pick up.
#
# The "deployment directory" is used because:
# * Prometheus doesn't support recursive globbing for rule files, thus we have to flatten directory trees.
# * It allows for further sanity checking pre-deployment, other than CI tests in the repo itself.

# All alerts-deploy invocations are wrapped in systemd one-shot services
# to get logging, error notification, etc out of the box.

# Calling 'systemctl start alerts-deploy.target' will force-run a deploy
# from the existing git repository (i.e. no git pull first)
