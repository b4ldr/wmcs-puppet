wikistats - a mediawiki statistics site

This sets up a site with statistics about
as many public MediaWiki installs as possible.

Not just WMF wikis, but any public MediaWiki install.

Currently it runs on instance in the 'cloud VPS' project 'wikistats'.

You can control this instance via https://horizon.wikimedia.org
if you are a member or admin of the project.

This is https://wikistats.wmcloud.org

I will likely stay a labs project forever although
results from it are used for some statistic tables
inside Wikipedia and other WMF wikis.

If it goes down it would be missed but it will not cause
any issues for production wikis. Just some outdated tables.


The matching software is in another repo:
operations/debs/wikistats

It started out as an external project to create
wiki syntax tables for pages like "List of largest wikis"
on meta and several similar ones for other projects

Not to be confused with stats.wikimedia.org and wikistats2
run by the WMF Analytics team.

To report bugs use https://phabricator.wikimedia.org and
tag a ticket with 'VPS-project-Wikistats'.
