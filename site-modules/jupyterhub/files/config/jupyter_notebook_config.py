# Explicitly configure the shell that will be used by the Jupyter Notebook Terminal app,
# AKA terminando.  Without this, Jupyter will launch the terminals as a login shell (-l).
# While this is often desired, in our case with stacked conda environments, the shell should
# already be set up properly, and we do not want e.g. /etc/profile sourced again.
