# == Class python_deploy::venv
#
# Deploy the bits needed to be able to deploy Python code in a simple manner, basically
# mimicking what scap does for the repositories of Python3 software that has frozen
# wheels and needs to be deployed in a virtualenv.
# This class was born as a workaround to not be blocked by the migration of Scap to
# Python 3 and might or might be not used after that.
#
# This class and scap::target are mutually exclusive, including both will results in
# compilation errors.
