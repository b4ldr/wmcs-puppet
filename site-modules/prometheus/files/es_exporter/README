# Queries are defined in sections beginning with 'query_'.
# Characters following this prefix will be used as a prefix for all metrics
# generated for this query

# Example 1:
# [query_all]
# Settings that are not specified are inherited from the DEFAULT section.
# The search query to run.
# QueryJson = {
#         "size": 0,
#         "query": {
#             "match_all": {}
#         }
#     }

# Example 2:
# [query_terms]
# The DEFAULT settings can be overridden.
# QueryIntervalSecs = 20
# QueryTimeoutSecs = 15
# QueryIndices = <logstash-{now/d}>
# QueryOnError = preserve
# QueryOnMissing = zero
# QueryJson = {
#         "size": 0,
#         "query": {
#             "match_all": {}
#         },
#         "aggs": {
#             "group1_terms": {
#                 "terms": {"field": "group1"},
#                 "aggs": {

#                 }
#             }

# QueryIndices should strongly consider using date math to only query the latest index:
