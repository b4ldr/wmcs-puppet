# = Class: prometheus::node_gdnsd
#
# Periodically export gdnsd stats via node-exporter textfile collector.
#
# Why not a gdnsd_exporter?
#
# In WMF's case there aren't a lot of machines with gdnsd deployed as of Dec 2016.
# Also, having an exporter would have the added benefit of being able to
# aggregate stats on other dimensions rather than per-cluster or per-site.
