# == Define: tlsproxy::localssl
#
# This definition creates a SSL proxy to localhost, using an Nginx site.
#
# === Parameters:
# [*server_name*]
#   Server name, used e.g. for SNI. Defaults to $::fqdn
#
# [*server_aliases*]
#   List of server aliases, host names also served.
#
# [*certs*]
#   Optional - specify either this or acme_subjects.
#   Array of certs, normally just one.  If more than one, special patched nginx
#   support is required.  This is intended to support duplicate keys with
#   differing crypto (e.g. ECDSA + RSA).
#
# [*certs_active*]
#   Optional - if "certs" above is used, this defines the subset of the certs to
#   actually configure on the server.  This allows for additional certs to be
#   fully deployed and OCSP stapled (ready for use), which aren't actually used
#   to serve traffic.  Defaults to the entire set from "certs".
#
# [*acme_chief*]
#   Optional - specify either this or acme_subjects.
#   If true, download, and potentially use, certificates from acme-chief.
#   If $certs is empty, acme-chief certificates will be used to serve traffic.
#   When used in conjunction with certs, acme-chief certificate will be deployed on
#   the server but certs specified in $certs will be used to serve traffic

# [*acme_certname*]
#   Optional - specify this if title of the resource and the acme-chief certname differs.
#
# [*acme_subjects*]
#   Optional - Enable the old LE puppetization. specify either this or certs.
#   This is also incompatible with using acme_chief
#   Array of certificate subjects, beginning with the canonical one - the rest
#   will be listed as Subject Alternative Names.
#   There should be no more than 100 entries in this.
#   This option will be removed in following changes. If you need to use LE certificates
#   please migrate to acme-chief ASAP.
#
# [*upstream_ports*]
#   TCP ports array to proxy to. Defaults to ['80']
#
# [*tls_port*]
#   TCP port to listen on as HTTPS.  This listener will proxy all traffic
#   to @upsteam_ports. Default is 443.
#
# [*redir_port*]
#   TCP port to listen on as plain HTTP.  This listener will redirect GET/HEAD
#   to HTTPS with 301 and deny all other methods with 403.  It does not proxy
#   any traffic. Default is undefined.
#
# [*default_server*]
#   Boolean. Adds the 'default_server' option to the listen statement.
#   Exactly one instance should have this set to true.
#
# [*do_ocsp*]
#   Boolean. Sets up OCSP Stapling for this server.  This both enables the
#   correct configuration directives in the site's nginx config file as well
#   as creates the OCSP data file itself and ensures a cron is running to
#   keep it up to date.  Does not work for ACME (letsencrypt) yet!
#
# [*access_log*]
#   Boolean. If true, sets up the access log for the localssl virtualhost.
#   Do NOT enable on the cache nodes. Defaults to false
#
# [*keepalive_timeout*]
#   Timeout (in seconds) for HTTP keepalive connections. The zero value disables
#   keep-alive client connections. Defaults to 60 seconds.
#
# [*keepalive_requests*]
#   The maximum number of requests that can be served through one keep-alive
#   connection. After the maximum number of requests are made, the connection
#   is closed. Defaults to 100 requests.
#
# [*read_timeout*]
#   Timeout (in seconds) for reading a response from the proxied server. The
#   timeout is set only between two successive read operations, not for the
#   transmission of the whole response. If the proxied server does not transmit
#   anything within this time, the connection is closed.  It should be set to
#   a value that corresponds to the backend timeout. Defaults to 180 seconds.
#
# [*only_get_requests*]
#  Deny all non-GET requests to this endpoint. Defaults to false.
#
# [*ssl_ecdhe_curve*]
#  Whether or not the nginx package has support for $ssl_ecdhe_curve. Defaults
#  to true.
# [*enable_http2*]
#  Whether to enable http2 or not. Defaults to false. It's best to only enable
#  this on public facing instances since in internal services (even if proxied
#  by the edge cache) it adds 1 more moving part without providing considerable
#  benefits
