# Class: statistics::published
#
# Sets up an rsync module and a cron that runs hardsync
# to merge multiple source directories into one.
# This allows remote hosts to push datasets here.
#
# This class does not rsync itself, it is expected that all
# desired files are pushed into $source by statistics::rsync::published.
#
# NOTE: $temp_dir should be set to the same filesystem as $source, as hardsync
# uses hardlinks to do the merging of $source/* directories.
