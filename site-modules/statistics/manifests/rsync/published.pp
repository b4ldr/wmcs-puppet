# Class: statistics::rsync::published
#
# Rsyncs $source to $destination/$::hostname using the
# published-sync script. The destination host is expected to use
# the statistics::published class to merge
# $::hostname directories into a single directory.
# This class should be included on the source host, not the
# remote destination host. The remote destination host must be able to accept
# rsyncs from this host at $destination (statistics::published will
# set this up).
