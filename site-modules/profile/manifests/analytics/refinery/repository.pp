# == Class profile::analytics::refinery::repository
#
# Deploy the analytics/refinery repository without any
# Hadoop or MediaWiki dependency. This profile is meant to be
# mostly used as part of profile::analytics::refinery, but it
# may also be deployed to hosts that don't need the full Refinery
# potential but only a specific subset (for example, the eventlogging
# database hosts need a whitelist file to purge data correctly, without
# the need to install a ton of Hadoop packages).

    # The analytics user/groups are deployed/managed by Scap.
    # The analytics_deploy SSH keypair files are stored in the private repo,
    # and since manage_user is true the analytics_deploy public ssh key
    # will be added to the 'analytics-deploy' user's ssh config. The rationale is to
    # have a single 'analytics' multi-purpose user that owns analytics deployment files.
