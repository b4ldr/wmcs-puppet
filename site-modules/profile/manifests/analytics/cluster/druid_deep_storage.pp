# This file ensures that druid users and groups exist, and that
# HDFS directories are created for Analytics Cluster druid clusters
# so they can be backed by HDFS for deep storage of datasets.
#
# This should be included on only one node that should also
# have druid users...a single Hadoop master is a good place.
