## template:jinja
{#
This is an override of the default file included in upstream debian
images. It's used by cloud-init to generate /etc/hosts when
manage_etc_hosts = True in the cloud config.

We're overriding the standard template by replacing the first
line, which looked like this:

127.0.1.1 {{fqdn}} {{hostname}}

The 127.0.1.1 entry is standard on debian as documented here:

https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html#_the_hostname_resolution

> The IP address 127.0.1.1 in the second line of this example may not
> be found on some other Unix-like systems. The Debian Installer creates
> this entry for a system without a permanent IP address as a workaround
> for some software (e.g., GNOME) as documented in the bug #719621.

I think we don't care about that use case. Instead we'll use
the actual IP.  Hard coding local IP in a cloud-init template
sort of defeats the purpose of cloud-init but since we're only
doing it on an up and running VM it seems harmless, and better
than trying to fight cloud-init's constant attempts to update.
