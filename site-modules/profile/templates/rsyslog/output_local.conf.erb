# Use lookup table to determine if log continues on to local outputs (defined
# in rsyslog.conf). If there is no entry in the lookup table for $programname,
# the default value defined by "nomatch" is "local".
# See https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/configuration/lookup_tables.html#lookup-table-file-format
#
# Note that the lookup is done at priority 10 by 10-lookup-output.conf, so
# setting $.log_outputs in a configuration with higher priority overrides the
# lookup.
if ( not ($.log_outputs contains "local") ) then {
