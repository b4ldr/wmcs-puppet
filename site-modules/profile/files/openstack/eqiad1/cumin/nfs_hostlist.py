# Script that can be run from the cloud-cumin host that can generate a
# list of all hosts that have NFS enabled, filtered by share.
# It looks at the nfs-mounts.yaml config to find the list of projects and
# relevant shares mounted per project, and uses the cumin library (that is
# already configured to talk to the Openstack API) to query for the list of
# matching hosts. It then excludes any hosts that may explicitly have NFS
# disabled through the mount_nfs Hiera key - and this data is queried from the
# Openstack-browser tool's hierakey API endpoint.
#
# For usage, see : nfs-hostlist -h
