Puppet is having issues on the "{fqdn} ({ip})" instance in project

Working Puppet runs are needed to maintain instance security and logins.
As long as Puppet continues to fail, this system is in danger of becoming
unreachable.

You are receiving this email because you are listed as member for the
project that contains this instance.  Please take steps to repair
this instance or contact a Cloud VPS admin for assistance.

If your host is expected to fail puppet runs and you want to disable this
alert, you can create a file under {disable_file}, that will skip the checks.
