# == Class: thanos::rule
#
# The thanos rule component runs Prometheus queries and is in charge of evaluating the following
# rules:
# * recording rules, and upload results to object storage
# * alerting rules, and send matching alerts to alertmanager

# Each site is meant to run one rule process for redudancy purposes, though more per site can be run
# at the same time (with distinct 'replica' labels). Each thanos rule will query its local thanos
# query on 'localhost'.

# The rule component also exposes StoreAPI and is discovered and queried by thanos query: this way
# recording rules are also available for querying.

# There are risks involved in evaluating rules when sites could be unavailable, read more at
# https://thanos.io/tip/components/rule.md/#risk

# = Parameters
# [*rule_hosts*] A mapping from fqdn to labels to use (currently 'replica' only).
#     This variable is expected to be something like { 'host1.domain' => { "replica" => "a" }, ... }
# [*objstore_account*] The account to use to access object storage
# [*objstore_password*] The password to access object storage
# [*alertmanagers*] All alertmanagers to send alerts to
# [*rule_files*] A list of globs to files to evaluate as rules
# [*http_port*] The port to use for HTTP
# [*grpc_port*] The port to use for gRPC
