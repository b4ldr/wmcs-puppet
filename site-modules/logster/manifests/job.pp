# == Define logster::job
# Installs a logster cronjob.
#
# == Parameters
# $parser            - Logster parser class name to use.
# $logfile           - Path to logfile to tail and report metrics about.
# $logster_options   - Full CLI option string to pass to logster.  Default: undef
#
# This class also takes the usual time frequency parameters that the cron
# resource type does: $minute (defaults to */5), $hour, $weekday, $month, $monthday.
# These are used for scheduling how often you want logster to parse the logfile
# and send metrics.
#
# NOTE: When defining job as 'absent', the package will become unmanaged
# and will need to be removed manually.
